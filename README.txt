### VERY VERY BAD, TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, ASTONISHING NOT GOOD ALPHA RELEASE ###


 * Author:
	mail: "stas" <cr@cker.com.br>
	site: http://sysd.org/


 * Purpose:
	Support for human-readable binary file patch format that crackers
	could use to share their work.

	bin_diff	=> Compares patched (cracked) file with original one
			   and generates modifications script.
	knuckle_cracker	=> Applies crack script generated by bin_diff.
			   Script may be passed as command line parameter
			   or you may bind it directly to executable:
			   "cat knuckle_cracker WinRAR_3.20.bss > cRARck"

	Compiles on Linux, FreeBSD (gcc) & Win32 (Borland C/CYGWIN/MinGW/MSVC).
